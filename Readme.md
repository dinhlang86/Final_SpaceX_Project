This is the capstone project for the IBM Professional Certificate in Data Science.

# Project background and context:
SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones.
It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars whereas other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage.

# Project Goals:
• Correlations between each rocket variables and successful landing rate.
• Conditions to get the best results and ensure the best successful landing rate.

# Results:
